## Generations

The Audi RS 3 has gone through three main generations since its introduction in 2011:

- **8PA (2011-2012)**: The first generation RS 3 was based on the Audi A3 (8P) platform and was available exclusively as a Sportback (five-door hatchback). It featured a 2.5-liter turbocharged five-cylinder engine producing 340 hp and 450 Nm of torque, paired with a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission and quattro all-wheel drive. This generation was limited to approximately 5,000 units worldwide. The 8PA RS 3 could accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 4.6 seconds and featured widened track, unique exterior styling, and sport-tuned suspension compared to the standard A3.

- **8V (2015-2020)**: The second generation RS 3 was initially offered as a Sportback and later as a sedan (from 2017). It utilized an updated version of the 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine, now producing 367 hp and later 400 hp after a facelift in 2017. This generation featured magnetic ride suspension, progressive steering, and launch control. The quattro system was enhanced with an electrohydraulic multi-plate clutch that could send up to 100% of power to the rear axle. The 8V RS 3 included distinctive RS styling elements such as the honeycomb grille, flared wheel arches, and oval exhaust pipes.

- **8Y (2021-present)**: The current third generation RS 3 is based on the MQB Evo platform and continues to feature the iconic 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine, now producing 401 hp and 500 Nm of torque. A significant technical advancement is the RS Torque Splitter, which replaces the rear differential with a dual-clutch pack that can actively distribute torque between the rear wheels, enabling drift mode. Available in both Sportback and sedan body styles, the 8Y generation features a more aggressive design with a wider track, specific RS bumpers, and a unique RS 3-specific grille. The interior received significant updates with a fully digital cockpit and enhanced infotainment system. Performance was further improved with 0-100 km/h acceleration in just 3.8 seconds.
